# Todor
A Simple to-do list from scratch using SwiftUI with a MVVM architecture pattern üì±,
also incorporate UserDefaults into the application to save and persist data between sessions.
*Made with love ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Mustafa Sabahy](https://github.com/mustafasabahy)*

<br />

## Built With üõ†
MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel...
The Model contains logic for the data layer.
The View contains logic for the app's UI.
The ViewModel contains the business logic for the app, connecting the View to the data (Models)!
